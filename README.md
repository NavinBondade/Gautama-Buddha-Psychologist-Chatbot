<p>In today’s fast-paced world, mental health challenges such as depression and anxiety have become increasingly prevalent. Many individuals, either due to their hectic schedules or a lack of awareness about the symptoms, often delay or avoid seeking professional help. To address this critical issue, I have developed an AI system that integrates the timeless wisdom of Gautam Buddha with the insights of modern psychology. This innovative system is designed to respond to users' mental health queries, offering practical and profound solutions aimed at permanently alleviating mental health concerns. By combining ancient teachings with contemporary psychological understanding, this AI provides a holistic approach to mental well-being, making support accessible to those who might otherwise not seek it.</p>
<h2>Libraries Used</h2>

  <li>LangChain</li>
  <li>Hugging Face</li>
  <li>ChainLit</li>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
The "Gautam Buddha Psychologist ChatBot" is engineered on the robust Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed to offer insightful solutions to users' mental health queries. At the core of this system is the zephyr-7b-beta large language model, which leverages advanced prompt engineering techniques to deliver precise and contextually relevant responses. 
</p>
<p>
The model operates by receiving a custom-crafted prompt that combines the user's question with pertinent context drawn from The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching. This book is transformed into vector embeddings through the sentence-transformer, enabling the system to perform a similarity search and accurately retrieve the most relevant context. This retrieved-context is then seamlessly integrated into the prompt provided to the model. The chatbot's interface and functionalities are built using the Chainlit framework, which ensures an intuitive and efficient user experience. Through this interface, users can interact with the chatbot effortlessly, receiving accurate and timely responses that blend the wisdom of Gautam Buddha with modern psychological insights.

<h2>Zephyr 7B Beta</h2>

</p>
<p>
The Zephyr series represents a cutting-edge collection of language models meticulously designed to function as highly effective and reliable virtual assistants. Zephyr-7B-β, the second model in this distinguished series, is an enhanced version that builds upon the capabilities of its predecessor. It is fine-tuned from the base model, mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1, which itself is a powerful and versatile model. Zephyr-7B-β has undergone rigorous training on a diverse blend of publicly available and synthetic datasets, ensuring it is well-equipped to handle a wide array of tasks with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.
</p>
<p>
What sets Zephyr-7B-β apart is its utilization of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) during the training process. This technique enables the model to better align with human preferences and deliver outputs that are not only accurate but also contextually appropriate and user-friendly. The fine-tuning process has refined Zephyr-7B-β's ability to understand and respond to complex queries, making it an invaluable tool for applications requiring a high degree of linguistic proficiency and contextual understanding. Whether used in customer support, content creation, or any other domain requiring sophisticated language processing, Zephyr-7B-β stands out as a premier model that exemplifies the advancements in AI-driven assistance.

<h2>Question Answered</h2>
<p>Below, I have asked the model how to keep mind calm? The model has successfully generated a very concise and accurate answer. The model has suggested to the user a five-step approach to calm his mind.</p>

<h2>Conversation With Our Psychologist ChatBot</h2>
<p>Here, I carried out some conversations with the model as a person who has some mental issues. I asked the model a few questions and requested to elaborate on its generated answer. All the responses generated by the model were very much aligned with Gautum Buddhas's teaching. They were rich with knowledge and had practical solutions. In testing, the model had not hallucinated or tried to make up things independently.</p>

</p>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>The model is also capable of remembering previous conversations and using them to understand the questions asked by the user accurately. In the below example, I asked the model "how to cure depression" and later asked "how long it will take to cure" without mentioning depression in the second question; the model correctly understood the user was talking about depression and generated a precise answer.</p>
