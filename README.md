<p>In today's fast-paced world, mental health issues have become very prevalent. People are constantly suffering from illnesses like depression and anxiety disorders. And because of their busy schedule or ignorance of the symptoms of such disease, people often avoid consulting a psychologist. In this project, I have built an AI system that utilizes the teachings of Gautaum Buddha and the knowledge of modern psychology to answer people's queries and provide concrete solutions for permanently fixing mental health issues. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
The "Gautaum Buddha Psychologist ChatBot" functions on the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework at its core to provide solutions to users' queries. The heart of this system is the zephyr-7b-beta large language model. Following the RAG framework and prompt engineering techniques, a custom-made prompt is provided to the model. This prompt includes the question asked by the user and the context related to the question. 
</p>
<p>
The source of the provided context is the book named The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching. This book is in the form of embeddings generated by sentence-transformer stored as vector embeddings. Using the similarity search algorithm, the correct context is searched out and then included in the prompt, which is provided as input to the model. The chainlit framework is used here to build the chatbot UI and other chatting functionality. Using the chainlit UI, the user can easily communicate with the model and get accurate answers within a few seconds.
